The team has grown and we've got a big pool of players of all levels and ages. There are two versions of the team

- the **czech team**, composed of core East Block players and playing at the national level
- the **european team**, including additional drafted players from all corners of the Czech Republic

Kristýna Tlustá continues as a fierce captain, joined by Michaela Mašková as a co-captain and Spirit captain. For the 2024 EUCF season, we have joined forces with none other that the amazing professional coach Valerio Iani. Last but not least, Lukáš Barborik became the assistant coach.
