The 2024 team has some new additions! The full practice roster includes ~30 players from the core East Block team - as playing on the national level - joined with amazing talent from other Czech teams.

Kristýna Tlustá (Kikča) continues as a fierce captain, joined by Michaela Mašková (Máša) as a co-captain and Spirit captain. For the 2024 EUCF season, we have joined forces with none other that the amazing professional coach Valerio Iani. Last but not least, Lukáš Barborik became the assistant coach.
