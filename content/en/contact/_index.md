## Wanna join the team?

**European team**

The tryout call for the european team is closed already as we've had our first tryouts with all players and our new coaches.

Want to play with us next season? Follow us on Instagram, or get in touch privately with the captains. We will publish a short questionaire after the season where you can apply :)

**Czech team**

If you want to train with us, you can do so either in 콯캞치r nad S치zavou with [Chupacabras](https://chupacabras.cz/treninky/) or in Slati켿any with [Chlupat치 쮂멱a](https://www.instagram.com/chlupatazaba.ultimate/). Go to their respective pages to learn more about the teams and when and where they are currently training. We will be glad to have you!

## Wanna become a sponsor?

As ultimate frisbee players, we are fully self-funded and the cost of tournaments can get pretty high. Most of the players are still students in high school or university and rely on the support of their parents. We would be grateful for support, be it a full-on sponsorship or just a small donation.

If you want to become a sponsor, reach out to us on email: [eastblockultimate@gmail.com](mailto:eastblockultimate@gmail.com).

If you want to donate, you can do so using this QR code. Our bank account is public, so you can see your donation up [here](https://ib.fio.cz/ib/transparent?a=2002285416) right away 游
