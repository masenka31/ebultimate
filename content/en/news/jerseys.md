East Block is proud to present new jerseys for the upcoming seasons! After working with the talented Daniel Korbel on a new logo, we can also show you the final jersey design. The **lynx** stays as the primary spirit animal, and the original one big stripe has been replaced with two.

#TODOs:
- [ ] Pictures!
- [ ] create the questionnaire
- [ ] change the date

We have decided to partner with [Flipwear](https://flipwear.es/home/) for the manufacturing and it was a perfect choice. Thanks to the whole Flipwear team for quick response on all the queries we had during the preparation process as well as assistance with making the final design decisions. The material is excelent, the design is sharp and the product line can accomodate all your wishes.

Do you want a jersey of your own, be it just for a casual wear or to show support and become a part of our fanclub? Click on the link below and fill in the questionnaire. If we get enough responses, we might create a fan order. Or we can message you when we are doing a new order in the future. Nothing is set in stone, we will reach to you by email before ordering anything, don't worry ðŸ™‚
