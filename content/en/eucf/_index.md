We finished 5th last year. There's a lot of changes in the team, but we are not slowing down, we are still going strong and gaining experience. It's not a good idea to underestimate us...

## 2025

This year's roadmap to EUCF is a bit different than last year. Unfortunately, we have to skip Elite Invite due to personal, financial and time reasons. But, there is still enough tournaments to go.

First ranking tournament. But is there a dark horse in the shadows, the infamous Beast Block?

Windmill is the best tournament in Europe and East Block will be there!
